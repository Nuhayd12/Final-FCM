## Rasberry Pi code
1. Lib camera error
2. Local host streaming for pi camera (face live recording only) 
3. Face recognition model app.py not working with picam
4. Licamera hello command is working but while running app.py says no module found
5. After many attempts of installation of libcamera and picamera2, it says numpy cannot convert array to jpeg
6. (Tried installing numpy using this link, but not working) [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/18sfyof/numpy_not_working_on_raspberry_pi/]
7. Likely compatibility issues (No problems in the code)
